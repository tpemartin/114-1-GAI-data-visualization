# GAI-Enhanced Data Visualizations

## Audience

Undergraduate economics students with little knowledge of R or Python.

## Course Overview

This course introduces economics undergraduates to using Generative AI for initial data exploration and how to leverage AI feedback to design effective data visualizations that highlight compelling narratives, focusing on the principles of clarity, impact, and appropriate design choices. Students will start to engage with small datasets and AI tools to identify potential stories and then refine their visualizations based on AI-driven design feedback, culminating in a visually compelling representation of a chosen narrative. They will also learn how to generate the design of static graphs with R or Python code using Google Colab. In class teacher uses R in tidyverse style. The course will also move on to interactive visualizations using Google Data Studio. Later students will deal with larger datasets that are improper for GAI tools to handle. They will learn how to apply sampling techniques to reduce the dataset size to fit GAI tool limits.

## 5E Model for each lesson

For each lesson, given the topic, discuss with me a proper dataset that fits the lesson. I will look for a dataset that fits the lesson. Design lecture and activities around the dataset that fits the 5E model. When there is participation needed, you can use Slido to facilitate that. I can design the Slido polls and questions and supply to you. Once all the lecture and activities are designed, you can generate a prompt that I can give to the students to do the activity.
