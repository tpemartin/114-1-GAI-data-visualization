## Teaching Flow Steps

1. Introduce Color Asthetics
   1. Talk about three different color types for visualizations: Categorical, Sequential, Diverging.
   2. Guide students to explore color schemes using [ColorBrewer](https://colorbrewer2.org/).  
   3. Discuss what they see in color variations: hue, saturation, brightness.  
2. Introduce Color Space HCL
   1. Guide students to inspect the HCL color space using [HCL Color Picker](http://hclwizard.org/hcl-color-picker/).  
   2. Explain the HCL color space and its components: Hue, Chroma, Luminance.  
3. Dive into Hue
   1. Explain the concept of Hue.
   2. Color theories: Complementary colors, Analogous colors.
4. Dive into Chroma and Luminance
    1. Explain Chroma (color intensity) and Luminance (brightness).
    2. Show how adjusting Chroma and Luminance affects color perception.
    3. Guide student to visit the AI expert 配色小幫手 (https://gemini.google.com/gem/412a145d1b40) before next step.
5. Primary, Secondary and Supporting background colors
   Ask students to use the AI expert to select their:
   1. Primary Color: The main color for their visualization.
   2. Secondary Color: A complementary color to the primary color.
   3. Supporting Background Color: A neutral color to enhance readability or act as supporting information.
6. Construct three types of color schemes
   Ask students to continue using the AI expert to construct:
   1. Categorical Color Schemes: the guideline is to vary Hue while keeping Chroma and Luminance constant. Starting from your primary and secondary colors, you can pick other colors by varying the Hue value. The rule of thumb: human has hard time to distinguish more than 4 categorical colors. 
   2. Sequential Color Schemes: the guidelines is to vary Luminance (and optionally Chroma) while keeping Hue constant. Starting from your primary color, you can create a gradient by adjusting the Luminance value from light to dark (or vice versa).
   3. Diverging Color Schemes: the guidelines is to vary both ends of the color spectrum while keeping the middle neutral. This is useful for displaying data that diverges from a central point. Starting from your primary and secondary colors, you can create a gradient that transitions from one color to the other, with a neutral color in the middle.
7. Recap and Share
   1. Recap the key concepts learned in this lesson.
   2. Encourage students to share their color schemes and discuss their choices.
