# Code based Data Visualization

## Objectives

  1. Understand how to use code to create data visualizations.
  2. How to 

## Teaching flow:

  1. Ask to start their data visualization AI expert upload the codebook of the dataset you want to visualize. 
  2. Tell students: To render graph with code, you need to introduce your working environment, the environment where you run code to analyse data, to AI such as:
     1. Dataset path.
     2. font path.  
  Show them **Introduction template** below to introduce working environment to AI.
  3. Tell: if you want AI to describe what he saw, you can save the graph's passing data frame as a csv file and upload it to AI.

## Introduction template

```
My programming environment is {{programming_environment}} with {{language}}. The working dataset is located at {{dataset_path}}. The font path is {{font_path}}.
```
