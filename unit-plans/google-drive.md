# Unit 0: Teaching Plan - Course Tools Quick Start

---

### **Unit Overview**
* **Subject:** GAI-Enhanced Data Visualizations
* **Audience:** Undergraduate economics students with little knowledge of R or Python[cite: 1].
* **Time Allotment:** 30 Minutes
* **Description:** This 30-minute session is the first step in a course designed to introduce students to using Generative AI for data exploration and visualization[cite: 2]. This introductory plan ensures all students are proficient with the basic tools (Google Drive, Sheets, Colab) before engaging with datasets and AI tools. The lesson is structured using a condensed 5E model[cite: 8, 10].

### **Learning Objectives**
By the end of this session, students will be able to:
1.  Create a new Google Sheet and a new Google Colab notebook.
2.  Organize these files within a specific Google Drive folder.
3.  Adjust sharing settings and submit a shareable link using an interactive tool.

### **Materials**
* Instructor computer with projector
* Student computers with internet access
* A shared Google Drive folder link for the course
* A prepared Slido event with three polls

## **Lesson Flow & Instructor Guide (30 Minutes)**

### **1. Engage (5 minutes): Setting the Stage**
* **Instructor Does:** Welcome students and activate the first Slido poll[cite: 11]. Briefly discuss the poll results to connect with students' prior knowledge.
* **Slido Poll (Multiple Choice)[cite: 11]:**
    > **Question:** How comfortable are you with using Google Colab and Google Sheets?
    > * A) Very comfortable, I've used them before.
    > * B) I've used Google Sheets, but not Colab.
    > * C) It's all brand new to me.
* **Instructor Says:** "Welcome! Before we dive into data, we need to set up our digital workshop. Let's see where everyone is starting from... Okay, looks like we have a good mix. In the next 30 minutes, we'll make sure everyone can create, manage, and share the files we'll use all semester for our analysis in R and Python." [cite: 4, 5]

### **2. Explore (10 minutes): Guided Hands-On Practice**
* **Instructor Does:** Guide students step-by-step on the projector screen as they create their own folders and files.
* **Activity Steps:**
    1.  Navigate to the shared course Google Drive folder.
    2.  Create a personal subfolder titled `[Last Name, First Name]`.
    3.  Inside your folder, create a new Google Sheet named `My First Sheet`.
    4.  Inside the same folder, create a new Google Colab notebook named `My First Colab Notebook`.

### **3. Explain (5 minutes): Understanding Sharing**
* **Instructor Does:** Demonstrate the "Share" button and clearly explain the "Viewer," "Commenter," and "Editor" permission levels. Launch a quick Slido quiz [cite: 11] to check for understanding.
* **Slido Quiz (Multiple Choice)[cite: 11]:**
    > **Question:** When sharing a file for me to grade, which permission level gives me access to leave comments without changing your work?
    > * A) Viewer
    > * B) Commenter
    > * C) Editor
* **Instructor Says:** "The most important step is sharing correctly. You want to select 'Commenter' so I can provide feedback directly on your assignments. Let's practice that."

### **4. Elaborate & Evaluate (10 minutes): Practice Submission via Slido**
* **Instructor Does:** Instruct students to generate their shareable link. Activate the final Slido poll [cite: 11] for them to submit their links.
* **Activity:**
    1.  In your `My First Colab Notebook`, click the "Share" button.
    2.  Change the access setting to "Anyone with the link can comment."
    3.  Copy the link.
    4.  Submit the link in the Slido poll.
* **Slido Poll (Open Text)[cite: 11]:**
    > **Question:** Please paste the "Commenter" link to your Google Colab notebook here.
* **Instructor Does:** As submissions appear live, click on 2-3 links to verify they open correctly with the right permissions. This provides immediate confirmation for the entire class.
* **Instructor Says:** "Excellent, I see the links coming in. Let's test this one... Perfect, I can see the notebook and have the ability to comment. It looks like you've all successfully set up the tools we'll be using for our data visualization work." [cite: 2]
