# Lesson Plan: Zero-Shot vs. Few-Shot Prompting

## Audience

High school or university students (beginner level with AI tools)

## Duration

90 minutes

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:

1. Explain what zero-shot prompting is and when to use it.
2. Explain what few-shot prompting is and when to use it.
3. Compare results from zero-shot and few-shot prompts.
4. Apply both methods to design their own effective prompts.

## Lesson Outline

### 1. Warm-up (10 min)

* **Activity:** Imagination exercise — *"If you had a perfect AI assistant, what would it do for you?"*

  * Students write down 3 tasks, 2 ways it would talk, 1 thing it should not do.
* **Goal:** Connect to the idea that prompts are instructions to shape behavior.

---

### 2. Introduction to Prompting (10 min)

* **Teacher Explains:** Prompt engineering = the art of turning your wishes into instructions for AI.
* Show a simple example:

```markdown
Summarize this paragraph in 3 bullet points.
```

* Emphasize: The clearer the prompt, the closer the AI acts like the imagined assistant.

---

### 3. Zero-Shot Prompting (15 min)

* **Definition:** Giving instructions without examples.
* **Analogy:** Asking a classmate to solve a problem without showing them how.
* **Demo:**

```markdown
Summarize today’s news article in 3 sentences.
```

* **Student Activity:** Each student writes a zero-shot prompt for a small task, such as:

```markdown
Tell me a short joke.
```

```markdown
Write a summary of this story in one sentence.
```

```markdown
Compose a 2-line poem about the ocean.
```

Share 2–3 examples aloud.

---

### 4. Few-Shot Prompting (20 min)

* **Definition:** Giving instructions **plus examples**.
* **Analogy:** Showing a classmate 2–3 solved problems before asking them to do one.
* **Demo (Pattern Recognition Example):**

```markdown
Examples:
"Apple is a fruit." → Category: happy
"Carrot is a vegetable." → Category: sad
"Salmon is a fish." → Category: sad
"Rose is a flower." → Category: sad

Task:
"Banana is a ..." →
```

* **Extended Demo:** Show that few-shot prompting can also be achieved through **conversation**.


Emphasize: Students don’t always have to write a long single prompt — they can build it interactively.

* **Student Activity:** Students create a few-shot prompt in two ways:

  * (a) A single prompt with examples.
  * (b) A conversation where they give examples turn by turn.
  * Compare which feels more natural.

---

### 5. Compare & Reflect (15 min)

* **Class Discussion:**

  * Put zero-shot and few-shot outputs side by side.
  * When did zero-shot work fine? When did few-shot make results more accurate?
* **Reflection Questions:**

  * Which method feels more natural to you?
  * Which is better for creative writing? For structured tasks?
  * Did building few-shot prompts through conversation feel easier?

---

### 6. Practice Challenge (15 min)

* **Task:** In pairs, design both a zero-shot and a few-shot prompt for the same task, for example:

```markdown
Generate 5 study tips for high school exams.
```

```markdown
Write a 2-day travel itinerary for Taipei.
```

* **Share Out:** Groups show their prompts and outputs.
* Class votes on the clearest example.

---

### 7. Wrap-Up (5 min)

* Recap key points:

  * Zero-shot = instructions only.
  * Few-shot = instructions + examples.
  * Few-shot can be written in one go or built through conversation.
  * Choice depends on task complexity and style needs.
* **Exit Ticket:** Write one sentence explaining when you would use few-shot prompting.

---

## Materials Needed

* Projector/screen for demos
* Student devices with AI access
* Whiteboard or digital board for class comparisons

---

## Assessment

* Participation in activities
* Quality of zero-shot vs few-shot prompts created
* Exit ticket response
